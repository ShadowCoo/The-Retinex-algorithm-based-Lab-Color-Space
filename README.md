# The-Retinex-algorithm-based-Lab-Color-Space
# The project is a graduation project
based on C++ 
use OpenCV3.4.1 and Qt Create 5.9.4
based on Lab color space and Retinex theory
before develope you need to complier and config OpenCV with Qt

# The Algorithm
  In this algorithm,we convert the image from RGB color space to Lab color space,the use the SSR,MSR,MSRCR algorithm process the component of L,the merge the L with a and b to a new image.

# The Image quality evaluation method
  In order to judge the enhancement of image quality by algorithms,choose the three method:
  1.articulation
  2.variance
  3.image information entropy
